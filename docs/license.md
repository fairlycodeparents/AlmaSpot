The decision to release AlmaSpot as open source was initially made due to the availability of free CI/CD tools (GitHub
Actions) for public repositories. In this context, our aim was to enable users to modify, redistribute and integrate the
software into other projects, including proprietary ones. For this reason primarily, we opted for the MIT license for
the AlmaSpot source code.

Although the application logic that we developed is governed by the MIT license, the system processes data (e.g.
lecture/exam schedules) released by Alma Mater Studiorum (University of Bologna) under a Creative Commons Attribution
3.0 license. The application complies with the specific attribution clause required by the data provider, thereby
keeping the software rights distinct from the data usage rights.
