# AlmaSpot 📍

AlmaSpot is a system designed for students at the University of Bologna, to assist the search for (study) spaces.

The project addresses the common issue of fragmented data regarding university schedules, which often makes it difficult
for students to access comprehensive, real-time information about room occupancy. By combining official academic
schedules with manually managed external activities, AlmaSpot offers a centralized platform for checking the
availability of classrooms and laboratories.
